Conducted Amazon sales analysis using SQL to derive insights into sales performance, trends, and key contributing factors.
In this project, we delve into analyzing sales data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.


## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.


## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists data representing Amazon sales transactions.
Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,products,
orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.


## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.


## Analysis Questions Resolved using SQL
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:

1.	What is the total revenue generated.
2.	How many products do we have.
3.	Find out top 5 order details by sales amount.
4.	What is the total sale for GOA.
5.	Find out the top 5 customers who made the highest profits.
6.	Find out the average quantity ordered per category.
7.	Identify the top 5 products that have generated the highest revenue.
8.	Determine the top 5 products whose revenue has decreased compared to the
9.	previous year.
10.	Identify the highest profitable sub-category.
11.	Find out the states with the highest total orders.
12.	Determine the month with the highest number of orders.
13.	Calculate the profit margin percentage for each sale (Profit divided by Sales), handle negative profit values.
14.	Calculate the percentage contribution of each sub-category


## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.	Ensure you have a SQL environment set up to execute queries.
3.	Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4.	Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyse the data and derive insights.
5.	Customize the analysis or queries as needed for your specific objectives.
